## Environment application 
### Mechanics
- open app
- map appears with blips for trash
- clicking a point on the map opens up the trash for it
    - shows picture of trash
    - how many points it's worth (changes based on CV)
    - gives option to give gps directions which opens google maps for now
    - button to pick up which prompts to take another picture and requires current location to be in proximity

### Things we want
- Google Map with images/waypoints
- Point system (ie 1pt = picture, 10pts = picking up) 
- Leaderboard view between users
- Notifications when "new litter" have been uploaded near you

### Extra
- Web AR to make the game more interactive
- Image recognition to check what trash it is 

## Drawing App

### Things we want
- Vector/Drawing (Paper.js or P5.js or Two.js, etc...)
- Recording video camera/audio + screen
- Steps recording (dynamic screen recording with timestamp)
