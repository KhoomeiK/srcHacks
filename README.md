## Mechanics
- open app
- map appears with blips for trash
- clicking a point on the map opens up the trash for it
    - shows picture of trash
    - how many points it's worth (changes based on CV)
    - gives option to give gps directions which opens google maps for now
    - button to pick up which prompts to take another picture and requires current location to be in proximity
